# Zombie Apocalypse AI Bot

This is the repository of a simple bot which can autonomously traverse a zombie-ridden world. I made most of in just under a week, using a framework given by my school [(DAE)](http://digitalartsandentertainment.be/).

Its main features include utilization of a behaviour tree, combined steering behaviours, and caching the world info it comes across.
